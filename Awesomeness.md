# Why Umbraco is pretty awesome

[<- home](README.md)

## Takes **literally** minutes to set up
You create an ASP.NET project, install a single NuGet package, click play, and follow a setup wizard to get connected to a database.

## Comes bundled with some really cool stuff
Johnny really likes the [Client Dependency](https://github.com/Shazwazza/ClientDependency) package, which makes bundling and minification a trivial exercise.  

## Umbraco Packages
Umbraco has a package manager baked in to the CMS itself. You can click buttons to install packages that do really helpful things like store media in blob storage.  

Additionally, each package lists the proven compatibility and reviews right in the package description! This takes a lot of the guesswork out of pulling in packages.  

For this reason, Johnny considers Umbraco to be the .NET version of WordPress. In WordPress, there is a package for ***everything***.
